# Simple-Car-Game
This is a simple car racing game where players control a car to avoid obstacles as they move down the screen. The game offers three difficulty levels: EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, each with increasing speeds to challenge the player’s reflexes and control. Players navigate the car left or right to dodge incoming enemy cars and prevent collisions. The game keeps track of the player’s score, which increases as they successfully avoid obstacles. It provides an engaging and visually appealing experience through console-based graphics.
